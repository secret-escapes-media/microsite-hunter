long-title: Win a winter escape to Middleton Lodge plus a Hunter wardrobe edit

intro: Set in the beautiful North Yorkshire countryside, the classic charms of Middleton Lodge are abundant. You’ll spend two nights in the wonderfully-rustic coach house, in a cosy room that continues the timeless styling of this sprawling Georgian estate. Wake up to breakfast, preparing yourself for a day’s adventure with the Hunter wardrobe edit; a pair of boots and a coat each awaits, ready in your room. Beyond the 200-acre grounds, you can face the cold with lengthy walks across the beguiling winter scenes of the North York Moors – with your new Hunter outerwear, you’ll stay toasty as you adventure across the blustery moorland landscape.
